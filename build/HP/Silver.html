			Our team believes that good Human Practice and Public Engagement have been our two most important intrinsic motivators, rather than iGEM requirements. This became clear in the period that our team got to know each other during our Masters. As we became good friends, we discovered that each individual team member had a strong desire to stop talking about the big problems that society faces nowadays and start contributing to the solution of these issues. From the very beginning, we were determined to make our project mean something and we hope it will have an impact that extends beyond the scope of the iGEM competition. Before and during the design of our project, we have consulted our stakeholders in order to identify, investigate and address several Human Practice issues to the best of our abilities. Our stakeholders come from various walks of life and include academia, industrial and regulatory bodies and the general public. We have visited several large-scale events, conducted interviews with experts from the field, recorded a series of podcasts and visited the Photanol pilot plant in order to identify the industrial settings for creating a cell factory. The incredible contributions from all our stakeholders, makes us feel that, no matter the outcome, our project has been an immensely rewarding experience.

			<p class="summary-text">When we first started this project, we weren’t really sure what industrial settings were. Therefore, we visited the Photanol pilot-plant to see not only how these industrial cultures are grown, but also the challenges that come with culturing cyanobacteria at such a large scale.<br>
			Once we were there, it became clear that in the greenhouse where the cyanobacteria are grown, the primary source of light is the sun. However, this also means that roughly half of the time, it is dark, and because these are photosynthetic organisms, this also means that half of the time they aren’t growing. Juliette Marin (Photanol) explained that determining whether your cells are actually producing the compound that you want is quite the hassle, as there is no quick and easy way to sense if the strain is producing.</p>

Virgil talked mostly about the friction between nature and sustainability and provided striking examples such as the "synthetic is not natural" discussion on Ecover and the “GMO-OMG” reflex.<br>A few months later, Virgil invited us for an interview, as he was shaping the future legislations on biosafety in synthetic biology. We shared our view on the current state of biosafety, the trends and the changes that have to be made to this legislation in order to keep up with the fast developing field of synthetic biology.</p>

We spoke about the reason for our project and the biosafety concerning the upscaling of our project. While upscaling is out of the scope of our project, we did want to design our project such that when our project would be viable to be used in industrial settings, the genetic engineering involved would not pose unnecessary risk to the general public.<br>We have stayed in contact and invited Korienke for our <a href="/Engagement.html#podcast" class="in-text-link" target="_blank">Podcast series</a>, where we spoke about biosafety regarding genetically modified organisms. We talked about the risks of genetic modification in bacteria, how genetic modification is regulated and how genetic modification can be safely applied on a large scale.</p>

Public engagement was further performed through many more channels. We have been on several radio broadcasts, locally and nationally, we published articles in popular online magazines such as ‘Scientias’ and ‘Bedrock’ and in print media such as the national newspaper ‘Nederlands Dagblad’. Furthermore, we joined the online community Amsterdam Smart City, attended public events such as the Climate Marathon and Knowledge Parade and produced a podcast series and several movies.
