Five of those are in the Bioinformatics and System Biology master and the other is in the Neuroscience bachelor. We got help from Mohammad, a syrian refugee, who helped us with building the wiki. For seven months we worked on our research at the Amsterdam Science Park, where dr. Filipe Branco dos Santos, Wei Du and Joeri Jongbloets were our supervisors.

A man of action who pursues a stable, green environment and world peace. Just as you are about to doze off into a deep slumber while listening to his gentle voice painting a bright future of the earth, he throws a right, a left and another right. Never a dull moment with this kickboxing smart ass.</p>

With a wide spectrum of qualities in research, she dominates the lab game with her superior skills and aim for perfection. With a bachelor in neuroscience and a sharp talking game, she is the one to take you on a relaxing 10-minute stroll if ever you need to be reminded of the bright side of life. When she is not in the lab, you can find her on a sailboat, the dancefloor or most preferably a combination of both.</p>

He prepared himself for this battle by growing a moustache and adding a Cyanobacterium tattoo to his biology-themed left arm. Committed as this man is, he is considering tattooing the logo of the most generous contributor on the very last available spot between his Erlenmeyer flask ink and his elbow. In both modeling and lab work he does not only walk the walk, but also talks the talk. When Max is not configuring chemofluxostats full of bacteria, he loves to play volleyball or create the occasional videogame.</p>

Our gaze stretched into astonishment as it turned out that he obtained the highest grades for the first courses. Now, six months later, this smart all-rounder is keeping up with the steep learning curve. He knows his way in business management and is familiar with the whims of a start-up, making him a valuable team member.</p>

He has worked with a wide variety of microorganisms, but remained susceptible to the scent of the sea: cyanobacteria became his topic of fascination. He is an assistant professor leading the Molecular Microbial Physiology Group of SILS. His article of faith relies in the ‘parallel’ concept: always bet on multiple horses. And especially this concept has brought our team to where we are now. Although he takes quite some of our time with his never ending stories, Filipe is the most driven and inspiring P.I. we could have wished for.</p>

While inspiring us and the rest of the world, he works his way towards programming for a living. Mohammad helped with the design of the wiki.</p>
