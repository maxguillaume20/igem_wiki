			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>  <p>A native fumarate transport system in <I>Synechocystis</i> is yet to be identified. However, we have successfully measured extracellular fumarate production in our engineered strains, suggesting a transport mechanism of some kind must to be present. But which?</p><p>We have carried a thorough bioinformatics homology search using sequences from known fumarate transporters from other organisms. Amongst the roughly 900 candidate genes of <I>Synechocystis</i> predicted to encode putative membrane proteins, we found two suitable targets that may encode components of a dicarboxylic acid transporter (such as fumarate). To test this in silico prediction we constructed single knock-out mutants of these putative genes of unknown function. Furthermore, we have also exploited the possibility of increasing fumarate production in our engineered strains through the expression of known heterologous fumarate transporters. This strategy has led to an increase in fumarate yields in <I>E. Coli</i> of 53%1 [1]. Two versatile <a href='/Parts.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>BioBricks</a> (<a href='http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2385001' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>Bba_K2385001</a> and <a href='http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2385000' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>Bba_K2385000</a>) have been constructed that encode fumarate transporters from <I>Escherichia coli</i> and <I>Nodularia Spumigena</i>. Finally, we performed extensive phenotyping of all the strains constructed, with particular emphasis on the impact of the genetic interventions on fumarate import and export.</p>

	  			<p id="intro1" class="collapsible-main-header">Introduction</p>
		  			<p>Our cyanobacterial cell factories produce fumarate intracellularly, but the fumarate that we measure (and could easily harvest in a <a href='/HP/Gold_Integrated.html#industrial' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>future downstream process</a> is extracellular. The efflux of fumarate that is taking place can be either the result of passive diffusion, or facilitated by a transport system. Fumarate is a dicarboxylic acid and has dissociation constants far below the intracellular pH of <I>Synechocystis</i>. This causes fumarate to be almost completely in its ionized form, which makes it much harder to diffuse across a hydrophobic membrane. A native fumarate transport system in <I>Synechocystis</i> is yet to be identified, but this strongly suggests a transport mechanism of some kind must to be present.</p>
		  			<p>A transport mechanism in the form of a protein can be studied by knocking out the encoding gene and study the resulting phenotype. To this end, we are forced to first identify candidate genes that may putatively encode fumarate transport proteins within the genome of <I>Synechocystis</i>. Membrane transporters are notorious for being promiscuous, often displaying affinity for multiple substrates [1]. However, their specificity for certain chemical properties (e.g. presence of two carboxylic acid groups) is often sufficiently conserved across phylogenetic clades [2], making it possible to attempt the identification of genes by sequence comparisons (i.e. by homology searching). Sequence alignments unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structure when the pairwise sequence identity is high (>40% for long alignments) [3]. Below 35%, the number of false positives increases tremendously and one can no longer infer a homologous relationship. Up to now, no C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter has been identified in <I>Synechocystis</i>, which already indicates that the search will not yield an unambiguous result. We went to see an expert in the field: <a href='/Attributions.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>Anton Feenstra</a>, an Assistant Professor Bioinformatics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>
		  			<p>Together we designed a pipeline to tackle the problem from every possible angle, aiming to provide the support required for an educated selection. We made use of targeted searches, where we used sequence information from known, phylogenetically closely related transporters, but also protein motifs and conserved domains as a template for sequence alignment. Complementary, untargeted searches were used to profile large groups of sequences (including putative identifications) and find distant homologous relationships between proteins.</p>
		  			<figure id='fig31'><img src='images/figures/Figure3.1_Pipeline.png' class='module-figure-image'><figcaption class='module-figure-text'><b>Figure 3.1</b> <i>Sequence homology Pipeline using untargeted and targeted searches. Four complementary tracks to identify putative genes encoding a dicarboxylate transporter in Synechocystis. </i></figcaption></figure>
		  			<p>The pipeline entails four complementary tracks (fig 3.1.). All sequence alignment tools are used in default settings unless stated otherwise. The e-value cut-off was set to 1.0 (as to include remote homologs and manually curate the results). To prevent profile wandering with iterative tools, the inclusion threshold (e-value) for PSI-BLAST was set to 0.05.</p>
		  			<p>(1) Several proteins(families) are involved in C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transport (e.g. Dcu-, Dct- and TRAP-transporters). For each of these target groups, sets of 200 transporter(domain) sequences were profiled using PRALINE<sup>&#8482;</sup>, an alignment method that integrates membrane-specific scoring matrices to improve alignment of the transmembrane regions [4]. It creates a Multiple Sequence Alignment file (MSA), that is taken as a template for HHSearch, present-day, the most sensitive protein sequence alignment method [5]. HHSearch computes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), similar to simple sequence profiles, but in addition to the amino acid frequencies in the columns of a MSA, they contain the position-specific probabilities for inserts and deletions along the alignment. The HMM is then aligned against the sequence database of  <I>Synechocystis</i> (tax id: 1148, which is a profile-profile alignment. By aligning profile HMMs instead of simple sequence profiles, both sensitivity and alignment quality improve significantly. This allows for the identification of more distant homologous relationships. </p>
		  			<p>(2) <I>Synechococcus elongatus</i> (<I>Synechococcus elongatus</i> hereafter) and <I>Nodularia Spumigena</i> (<I>N. Spumigena</i> hereafter) are phylogenetically closely related to <I>Synechocystis</i> (also cyanobacteria) and widely studied. In <I>Synechococcus elongatus</i>, two C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter(domain)s have been identified: DctM and DctA. In <I>N. Spumigena</i>, a DcuC transporter is putatively identified based on sequence homology studies. In separate searches, each of the gene sequences was used as a template to create a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), using PSI-BLAST on the NCBI NR db [6]. This was done in order to 'enrich' the sequence with information from related sequences.. ClustalX is used to create a MSA out of the PSSM, as this is the most sensitive method that is able to take a PSSM as template [7]. The MSA is subsequently taken as a template for HHSearch.</p>
		  			<p>(3) NCBI's Conserved Domain Database is a collection of representative sequences and PSSMs, that represent evolutionarily conserved sequence fragments (or domains) [8]. It provides functional characterization based on the presence of signature sequence patterns and may serve as a starting point for functional annotation and classification. The database has annotated conserved domains for several C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transport(domain)s: DctP, DctM, Dcu and DcuC. For each of the profiles, Clustal and subsequently HHSearch was used to identify remote homologs in <I>Synechocystis</i>. </p>
		  			<p>(4) The PROSITE database consists of a large collection of biologically meaningful signatures that are described as patterns or profiles [9]. Each signature is linked to a documentation that provides useful biological information on the protein family, domain or functional site identified by the signature. The database has two family signatures (in Clustal output format) for sodium:dicarboxylate symporters. For each of the profiles, HHSearch was used to identify remote homologs in <I>Synechocystis</i>.</p>
		  			<p>All sequence alignment tools are used in default settings unless stated otherwise. The p-value cut-off was set to 1.0 (as to include remote homologs and manually curate the results), except for iterative tools (such as PSI-BLAST) where the cut-off was set to 0.05 to prevent profile wandering.</p>
	  			<p id="id='results1" class="collapsible-main-header">Results & discussion</p>
		  			<p>As stated in the introduction, sequence identities below 35% are not sufficient to imply a homologous relationship. Therefore, we will only highlight the genes that pop up as a hit in multiple tracks, this to ensure that a random alignment (false positive) will not be taken as putative target.</p>
		  			<p>The first gene that appears 2 times in tracks 2 and once in track 3 is <I>sll1103</i>. It is mapped to the conserved domain of DctM (pfam06808) with an E-value of 2.5 E<sup>-44</sup>, shares 31% sequence identity to the DctM subunit from Synechococcus (EHA61938.1) and 20.7% to DcuC from <I>N. Spumigena</i> (AHJ29173.1) (fig. 3.2). Additionally, sll1104, located in the same transcriptional unit, aligns with an E-value of 1.1 E<sup>-19</sup> in track 1 when using DcuB as a query.</p>
		  			<p> The second gene that appears both in track 2 and 3 is <I>sll1314</i>. This gene is mapped to the conserved domain of DctP (TIGR00787) with an E-value of 3.3E<sup>-106</sup> and shares 25% sequence identity to the DctP subunit from Synechococcus (WP_015168385). </p>

		  			<p>Now that we have made an educated guess on the proteins involved in fumarate transport, we need to experimentally validate their function. In order to find the role that these genes may play in fumarate transport, <I>sll1103</i> and <I>sll1314</i> were deleted in <I>Synechocystis</i> wild type and the derivative fumarate producing strain, <i>&#916;fumC</i>. Genes were deleted using a <a href='/Methods.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>markerless genetic modification</a> method. This way, our newly designed strains will never be at risk of passing on to natural environments resistance cassettes. These strains were then characterized phenotypically in a series of different experiments in order to address our different research questions:</p>
		  			<ul class='export-list'><li>We study the effect of the deletions on fumarate efflux by cultivating the double knock-out strains (&#916;fumC&#916;sll1103 and &#916;fumC&#916;sll1314) with &#916;fumC as a control.</li><li>The effect of the deletions on fumarate influx was studied by cultivating the single knock-out strains (&#916;sll1103 and &#916;sll1314) with the wild type as a control in the presence of exogenously supplemented fumarate.</li><li>The postulated promiscuity of the tentatively annotated dicarboxylate transporters, sll1103 and sll1314, was tested for multiple substrates by performing high-throughput phenotyping array screens using BIOLOG plates. </li></ul>
	  			<p id="results2" class="collapsible-main-header">Results & discussion</p>
		  			<p>The targets <I>sll1103</i> and <I>sll1314</i> (genes encoding putative fumarate transporters) were  deleted on wild type and <i>&#916;fumC</i> background (fig. 3.3). </p>
		  			<figure id='fig33'><img src='images/figures/Figure3.3_knockout_confirmation.png' class='module-figure-image'><figcaption class='module-figure-text'><b>Figure 3.3</b> <i>PCR confirmation of gene deletions on wild type and <I>&#916;fumC</i> background of <I>&#916;sll1103</i> (A) and<I>&#916;sll1314</i> (B). A clean knockout gives a single DNA band at 2.023 bp, while for wild type (WT) this is 3.287 bp. </i></figcaption></figure>
		  			<p>First, we studied the effect of the deletions on fumarate efflux by cultivating the double knock-out strains (<i>&#916;fumC&#916;sll1103</i> and <i>&#916;fumC&#916;sll1314</i>) with <i>&#916;fumC</i> as a control for 150 hours, while monitoring cell growth and fumarate production. We hypothesized that if one of the genes encodes a protein involved in fumarate export, we should measure less extracellular fumarate compared to the control strain.</p>
		  			<p>Neither of the two gene deletions led to an inhibition of cell growth (fig. 3.4A). We are mostly interested in the log phase, as this is where the fumarate is produced (remember that <i>&#916;fumC</i> is a <I>Synechocystis</i> derivative producing fumarate as the cell grows). Zooming in on T = 49 (log phase) we can see that deletion of <I>sll1103</i> causes a diminishable and insignificant decrease in fumarate efflux (fig. 3.4B). Deleting <I>&#916;sll1314</i>, on the contrary, causes a significant decrease in fumarate efflux of 31 % (p-value < 0.01, ANOVA). The fact that we still see extracellular fumarate suggests that <I>sll1314</i> is not the only transport system for fumarate, but this result validates that <I>&#916;sll1314</i> is involved in fumarate transport. </p>
		  			<figure id='fig34'><img src='images/figures/Figure3.4_knockout_experimentdata.png' class='module-figure-image'>  <figcaption clas's='module-figure-te''xt><b>Figure 3.4</b> <i>Cell growth (measured at OD<sub>730</sub>) in different <I>Synechocystis</i> strains under constant light illumination for over 150 hours (A). Fumarate concentration in mM per OD for T = 49. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval. (n='3' for double knock-outs, n='2' for <I>&#916;fumC</i>). </i></figcaption></figure>
		  			<p>Secondly, the effect of the deletions on fumarate influx was studied by cultivating the single knock-out strains (<I>&#916;sll1103</i> and <I>&#916;sll1314</i>) with the wild type as a control in the presence of exogenously supplemented fumarate. We hypothesize that if these genes are involved in fumarate import, than we should see a difference in fumarate uptake kinetics under conditions in which cells are forced to uptake fumarate in order to grow, i.e. in the presence of the photosynthesis inhibitor DCMU.</p>
		  			<figure id='fig35'><img src='images/figures/Figure3.5_reassimilation_data.png' class='module-figure-image'>  <figcaption clas's='module-figure-te''xt><b>Figure 3.5</b> <i>Fumarate (mM) over time for different <I>Synechocystis</i> strains cultivated for 6 days. </i></figcaption></figure>
		  			<p>We can see that both wild type and<I>&#916;sll1103</i> have restricted/no capability to assimilate fumarate, under the conditions tested (fig. 3.5). Our results thus strongly hint the absence/deficiency of the fumarate import transporter in <I>Synechocystis</i>.</p>
		  			<p>Lastly, the postulated promiscuity of the tentatively annotated dicarboxylate transporters, <I>sll1103</i> and <I>sll1314</i> ,was tested for multiple substrates by performing high-throughput phenotyping array screens using BIOLOG plates. We hypothesize that if the target genes are involved in the uptake of other compounds, than we should see a difference in this screen when comparing the single knock-out strains (<I>&#916;sll1103</i> and <I>&#916;sll1314</i>) with the wild type as a control. Comparisons can be performed in cells taken from cultures in the light and in the dark, since they display different expressions patterns [13]. </p>
		  			<p>We did not observe any differences in BIOLOG screen between wild type and the derivative knock out strains <I>&#916;sll1103</i> and <I>&#916;sll1314</i>. This suggests that these two genes do not encode proteins involved in the transport of the substrates tested (fig. 3.6) This however does not mean that they may not be involved in the transport of other substrates, or that their expression pattern in wild type under different conditions could not have lead to a different conclusion.</p>

		  			<p>Current data on fumarate production in <I>Synechocystis</i> does not indicate that fumarate yields produced in our cell factories exceed the native transport capacity (at least not yet!) [14]. This indicates that overexpressing a transporter is not expected to have a great impact on fumarate productivity. However, this knowledge is based on model predictions and has not been fully experimentally validated.</p>
		  			<p>Therefore, we decided to express in <I>Synechocystis</i> the transporter leading to the highest fumarate yield increase in <I>E. Coli</i> (identified by Zhang et al.)[1]. This is a C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate carrier, DcuC, with efflux as a major function (hereafter termed DcuC-ec). Bearing in mind that transporters are often not expressed or not correctly folded in a non-native host [1], we decided to also include a transporter from an organism that is more closely related phylogenetically. <I>Nodularia Spumigena</i>, also a cyanobacterium, encodes a putative transporter (hereafter termed DcuC-NS), which is similar to the one used in the Zhang study. </p>
		  			<p>Both transporters are from the DcuC family, a family of transporters present only in (facultative) anaerobic bacteria capable of fumarate respiration. DcuC-ec is able to catalyze the uptake, antiport, and efflux of C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates (succinate, fumarate, malate) and C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylic amino acids (aspartate), but the Kd values for the various substrates may differ [2]. It is only expressed under anaerobic growth conditions and has efflux as a major function. In the neutral pH range (pH 6-9) divalent C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates (e.g. fumarate<sup>2- </sup>) are the substrates and can leave the cell in counter exchange with succinate (eq. 1) or through electrogenic symport (eq. 2).</p>

Standard biological parts (like these) and molecular biology tools have been developed for widely studied organisms as <i>E. Coli</i>. These parts can also be used in other organisms, but characterization of parts in a non-native host, reveals differences in performance. This emphasizes the importance of detailed part-characterization for a specific biological chassis. Good characterization and documentation would open up the possibility of enhancing the productivity of traditional (algal) compounds and producing new ones through metabolic engineering, bringing us one step closer to a biobased economy.</p>
		  			<p>We overexpressed the genes separately in wild type and in the <i>&#916;fumC</i> strain. In order to investigate the effect on fumarate production, we cultivate the newly designed strains and monitor cell growth and fumarate production. </p>
	  			<p id="results3" class="collapsible-main-header">Results & discussion</p>
		  			<p>We overexpressed DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS (ec = <I>E. Coli</i>, NS = <I>N. Spumigena</i>, cyanobacterium) separately in wild type and in the <i>&#916;fumC</i> strain. Unfortunately, we were only able to get the strains on wild type background ready in time (fig. 3.7). Nonetheless, we can still study the effect on fumarate efflux by cultivating the expression strains (DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS) on the wild type background, while using <i>&#916;fumC</i> as a positive control, while monitoring cell growth and fumarate production for 150 hours.</p>
		  			<figure id='fig37'><img src='images/figures/Figure3.7_DcuC_confirmation1.png' class='module-figure-image'><figcaption class='module-figure-text'><b>Figure 3.7</b> <i>PCR confirmation of gene expressions on wild type background of DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS. A clean expression gives a single DNA band around 3.120 bp, while for wild type (NC) this is approximately 312 bp. </i></figcaption></figure>
		  			<p>After 150 hours, no extracellular fumarate is being produced by neither the DcuC-ec nor DcuC-NS expression strains (fig. 3.8A). The &#916;fumC is used as a control for fumarate production and produces roughly 1 mM of fumarate after 150 hours. This indicates that under these conditions heterologous expression of DcuC alone, irrespective if it is from <I>E. Coli</i> or <I>N. Spumigena</i>, is not sufficient for fumarate to be secreted above our detection limit (~0.05 mM). To our surprise, we measure extracellular lactate being produced by DcuC-NS with a maximum of 5 mM (fig. 8B). Lactate often indicates that there is a contaminant, but extensive contamination checks did not show contamination of any kind.</p>

		  			<ul class='export-list'><li>We were able to integrate the heterologous transporters DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS into the genome of Synechocystis.

This will test simultaneously whether intracellular fumarate was the limiting factor in the experiment described above; and whether it is inhibiting its own production, and potentially even growth, in the strain with the &#916;fumC genotype.</li></ul>

		  			<p class='project-header'>Cultivation conditions</p>
		  			<p>Cultures during plasmid construction in <I>E. Coli</i> were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) plates (1,5% agar) or LB liquid medium at 37&#8451; in an incubator with a shaking speed of 200 rpm. <I>Synechocystis</i> was grown in BG11 standard medium, together with 10 mM TES-NaOH (pH = 8.0). Appropriate antibiotics were used, alone or in combination, in the following concentrations: 50 &#956;g mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin, 100 &#956;g mL<sup>-1</sup> ampicillin and 30 &#956;g mL<sup>-1</sup> nickel. </p>
		  			<p class='project-header'>Sampling and Fumarate measurements</p>
		  			<p>Cell culture samples were harvested at selected time points for OD and fumarate analysis. 1 ml of sample was centrifuged at 15.000 rpm  for 10 min. Then 500 &#956;l supernatant was taken and filtered (Sartorius Stedin Biotech, minisart SRP 4, 0.22 &#956;m) for sample preperation. Fumarate concentration was measured by HPLC-UV/VIS (LC-20AT, Prominence, Shimadzu), with ion exclusion Rezex ROA-Organic Acid column (250x4.6 mm; Phenomenex) and UV detector (SPD-20A, Prominence, Shimadzu) at 210 nm wavelength. 10 &#956;L of the HPLC samples were injected through an autosampler (SIL-20AC, Prominence, Shimadzu), with 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as eluent at a flow rate of 0.15 ml min<sup>-1</sup> and column temperature of 45 &#8451;. </p>

		  			<p><I>sll1103</i> (BAA18318.1) and <I>sll1314</i> (BAL35144.1) were deleted in wild type <I>Synechocystis</i> and in the fumarate producing <i>&#916;fumC</i> strain. Gene deletion was done according to the <a href='/Methods.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>markerless genetic modification</a> method, with kanamycin as a positive selection marker (50 &#956;g/ml). Homologous regions were amplified using primers up_fwd and up_rev (H1) and down_fwd and down_rev (H2). Segregation was checked using (colony)PCR with primers up_fwd and down_rev. All primers used are listed in table 1. The resulting, markerless deletion strains are listed in table 2.</p>

		  			<p class='project-header'>Overexpressing transporters to increase fumarate yield</p>
		  			<p>For the expression of heterologous transporters in <I>Synechocystis</i>, a C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter gene DcuC (NP_415154) was amplified from the genome DNA of <I>Escherichia coli</i>. Homologous regions were amplified using primers DcuC_ec_up_fwd and DcuC_ec_up_rev (H1) and DcuC_ec_down_fwd and DcuC_ec_down_rev (H2). DcuC-NS (AHJ29173.1) from <I>Nodularia Spumigena</i> was synthesized at IDT as a gene-block. The genes were integrated into the genome of wild type <I>Synechocystis</i> and <i>&#916;fumC</i>, directly downstream of the psbA2 promotor, as described elsewhere [15]. Segregation was checked using (colony)PCR with primers on the expression vector. All primers used are listed on in table 1. The resulting expression strains are listed in table 2.</p>
	  			<p id="" class="collapsible-main-header">Characterisation</p>
		  			<p>We study the effect of gene modifications on growth and fumarate transport in a <a href='/Methods.html#multicultivator' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>multi-cultivator</a>. The cultivator consists of eight vessels, each containing a <I>Synechocystis</i> strain. </p>
		  			<p class='project-header'>Experiment 1 - The effect of gene deletions on fumarate efflux<p>
		  			<p>We study the effect of the gene deletions on fumarate efflux by cultivating the double knock-out strains <i>&#916;fumC</i><I>&#916;sll1103</i> (in triplicate) and <i>&#916;fumC</i><I>&#916;sll1314</i> (in triplicate), with <i>&#916;fumC</i> (produces fumarate in a stable fashion) as a control (in duplicate). Sampling was done once a day, as described above. </p>
		  			<p class='project-header'>Experiment 2 - The effect of gene deletions on fumarate influx</p>
		  			<p>We study the effect of the gene deletions on fumarate influx by cultivating the single knock-out strain <I>&#916;sll1103</i> (in duplo) and wild type <I>Synechocystis</i> (in duplo) with and without external fumarate supplemented (5mM) to the cultures. Sampling was done once a day, as described above. </p>
		  			<p class='project-header'>Experiment 3 - The effect of gene deletions on the 'metabolic fingerprint' of <I>Synechocystis</i></p>
		  			<p>Further characterization of the deletion strains was done making a so called 'metabolic fingerprint' on a Biolog Ecoplate<sup>TM</sup>. This was done for the single knock-out strains <I>&#916;sll1103</i> and <I>&#916;sll1314</i>, with wild type as a control. The Biolog Ecoplate<sup>TM</sup> comprises of 96 wells, containing 31 of the most useful carbon sources in triplicate [16]. Formation of purple color occurs when the microbes can utilize the carbon source and begin to respire. The respiration of the cells in the community reduces a tetrazolium dye that is included with the carbon source. One plate was inoculated in singleton with wild type, <I>&#916;sll1103</i> and <I>&#916;sll1314</i> at OD<sub>730</sub> 0.5 from a culture that had been growing in continuous light. The plate was incubated at 30 &#8451; and OD was measured daily with a BMG FluoStar Optima plate reader, using emission at 600 nm. Another plate was inoculated according to the same scheme, after 24 hours of dark incubation. </p>
		  			<p class='project-header'>Experiment 4 - The effect of heterologous gene expression on fumarate efflux</p>
		  			<p>We study the effect of the heterologous gene expressions on fumarate efflux by cultivating the DcuC-ec (in triplicate) and DcuC-NS (in triplicate), with <i>&#916;fumC</i> (produces fumarate in a stable fashion) as a control (in duplicate). Sampling was done once a day, as described above. </p>
