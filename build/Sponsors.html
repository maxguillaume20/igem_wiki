				<p class ="sponsor-title">Integrated DNA Technologies</p>
				<p class ="sponsor-txt">Integrated DNA Technologies sells short strands of DNA called oligonucleotides. The way that one strand of DNA specifically binds a second strand of DNA allows scientists to use short DNA strands (oligos) as research tools. A short synthetic piece of DNA can be used to bind or find its matching sequence even in a complex mixture of millions of unrelated pieces of DNA. It is this unique fact that allows researchers to decode and study the genetic makeup of any living organism. Using new oligo-based technologies, a revolution is underway where we are beginning to catalog the complete genetic makeup of hundreds of living things, ranging from bacteria to humans. Given a known DNA sequence, scientists can easily design a short oligo that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. It is this short single-stranded DNA that the researcher orders from IDT. IDT manufactures the oligo using chemical DNA synthesis machines designed and built in-house. They've refined the process to the point where we can receive an order as late as 1:00pm and have the desired oligo in the researcher's hands the next morning. Our customers range from small university labs of only a few scientists to global pharmaceutical companies, and everything in between.</p>

The institute comprises biological disciplines including molecular and cell biology, microbiology, plant science, physiology and neurobiology, supported by modern enabling technologies for the life sciences. The research groups of SILS also develop methods in genomics (micro-array, next-gen sequencing, proteomics), bioinformatics and advanced light microscopy technologies. Knowledge from adjacent fields of science, in particular biochemistry, biophysics, medicine, bioinformatics, statistics and information technology make SILS a multidisciplinary research institute with a systems biology approach to the life sciences. SILS' research objective is to understand the functioning of living organisms, from the most basic aspects up to complex physiological function(s). Biological processes are studied at the level of molecules, cells, cellular networks and organisms. SILS research topics have in common that similar cellular processes and interactions are studied, likewise using similar methodologies and technologies. Therefore SILS scientists often study the same concepts in different biological systems. Within the institute, this leads to exchange of information and extension of research over the borders of different disciplines. Part of SILS research activities are directed to application-oriented research in close collaboration with industry.</p>
