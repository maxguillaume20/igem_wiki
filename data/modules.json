              "<p>Currently fumarate concentrations in liquid samples can be quantified through two well-developed methods, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzymatic assays. Both methods are costly and labor intensive. In our search for cyanobacterial cell-factories we need to measure fumarate concentrations very often. Measurements need to be accurate and specific to fumarate, and on top of that measuring should be quick and easy. Fortunately, synthetic biology may be used to derive a solution to this inspired in nature.</p>",
              "<p>Bacteria have evolved to use two-component systems (TCS) to sense and adapt to changes in the extracellular environment. These systems are often highly specific to particular compounds and accurate in their measurement [1]. A TCS typically consists of a sensor histidine kinase (SHK) and a response regulator. The first sits in the membrane and gets activated upon sensing particular signals such as a specific compound The second gets activated by an active SHK and can then bind to DNA at specific loci to initiate a biological response [2]. We construct a fumarate biosensor based on the DcuSZ/OmpR chimeric TCS developed in <i>E. coli</i> by Ganesh et al. (2013) [3]. The SHK in this system, DcuSZ, is a fusion of two native <i>E. coli</i> SHKs, fumarate sensor DcuS and osmolarity sensor EnvZ. The protein domains in DcuSZ are the extracellular sensing domain and transmembrane domains of DcuS and the intracellular HAMP and histidine kinase domains of EnvZ. Coupling the emerging TCS to the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein leads to cells that fluoresce in response to extracellular fumarate (fig. 4.1).</p>",

Coupling this to fluorescent protein (EYFP) expression by using the ompC promoter leads to sensing and reporting of fumarate.</i></figcaption></figure>",
              "<p>We have created several differently fused DcuSZ genes to compare their functionality. The difference is in the length of the linker region between the DcuS and EnvZ functional domains. The linker region originates from the DcuS gene and forms an &#945;-helix. A complete turn in an &#945;-helix consists of approximately 3.6 amino acids, so by differing the linker length in steps of 5 amino acids we extend or shorten the &#945;-helix by &#126;1.4 turns per step taken. This results in a titration of the different orientations of the EnvZ kinase relative to the membrane bound DcuS domains, and thus relative to the membrane. We expect the linker length and kinase orientation play a central role in the functionality of the system. By creating 9 DcuSZ genes with different lengths (fig. 4.2), at least one of them, and at best two, are predicted to be close to the optimal orientation. By taking more than one turn per step we also scan a relatively large range of distance between the DcuS and EnvZ functional domains. This may influence the kinetics of binding and activation of the engineered TCS, possibly leading to variants with different detection limits and signal dynamic ranges for fumarate.

This screening suggested that strains 1, 6 and to some extent 9 are functioning as biosensors. The screening also showed that the response in fluorescence/OD<sub>600</sub> is robust over time. Times of measurement were quite high, namely 16 and 22 hours, because the signalling system was only induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) upon addition of fumarate. Ideally the system would be induced before adding fumarate, as in our case there is more time in which the strains can take up the fumarate. However, fumarate uptake is repressed by the presence of glucose in the medium [4].</p>",

By fitting a logistic curve to the data the detection limits and saturation levels of each sensing strain can be determined. Several nice examples of the logistic nature of similar sensing systems are shown by Pollard et al. (2016) [5]. By varying the linker length, and with that the kinase orientation, we expect to have changed the effectiveness of signal transduction in the chimeric DcuSZ protein. While intuitively one might expect only the range of signal detection to differ as a consequence, in reality the dynamics of the fluorescence output vary widely (fig. 4.3).</p>",

DcuSZ 1 and 6 do have similar lengths, but DcuSZ 9 is 15-20 amino acids longer than DcuSZ 1 and 6, and yet strain 9 is also functional. The characterization suggests that strain 1 can be used to quantify fumarate concentrations up to 3 mM, strain 6 up to 6 mM and strain 9 even up to 20 mM (fig. 4.3). To quantify fumarate concentrations below 1 mM, calibration in the 0-1 mM range should be performed. While strain 9 can measure up to the highest fumarate concentration, it is less sensitive than strains 1 and 6. The logistic fit is the best for strain 6 and therefore its curve is the most trustworthy. The spread in the fluorescence/OD<sub>600</sub> of strain 1 is high, which leads to more uncertainty as to the level of saturation of this biosensor. The specificity to fumarate of these systems should be tested by comparing the response found here to the response to other C4-dicarboxylates (succinate, malate and aspartate). Previous work shows that the DcuSZ/OmpR system with the kinase orientation and linker length as they are in strain 1 is highly specific to fumarate [3].</p>"

A recent quantitative analysis of the various ways to convert the energy of photons to chemical bonds has revealed that the direct utilization of sunlight is the most efficient [1]. This however means that cells will be exposed to diurnal regimes in which they will inevitably be exposed to periods of darkness. Our goal here is to achieve the first photoautotrophic cell factories that are able to stably produce fumarate around the clock. </p>",
    "overview": "<p><i>Synechocystis</i> does not naturally produce fumarate. However, model guided engineering found that removing a single gene within <i>Synechocystis</i> leads to a stable cell factory that produces fumarate as it grows during the day. Nevertheless, at night our cells do not produce fumarate, since at night, they don't grow. To overcome this challenge, we have taken a systems biology approach which interweaves theory, modeling, and experimentation to implement stable nighttime production of fumarate. We theorized that we can redirect the nighttime flux towards fumarate production by removing a competing pathway via knockout of the <i>zwf</i> gene.  Additionally, we also took inspiration from nature and speculated that the incorporation of the glyoxylate shunt would further increase our nighttime production of fumarate. Our models corroborate these predictions, however, they also suggest that the stability of the glyoxylate shunt is sensitive to the timing of when the shunt is turned on (i.e. expressed). We therefore took a robust approach to incorporate the glyoxylate shunt enzymes under ideal expression conditions.</p>",

This occurs because most commonly used metabolic engineering approaches make products in direct competition with biomass formation, which imposes high fitness burdens on production strains. This ultimately leads to a rapid appearance of suppressor mutations, for instance in the form of insertions or deletions, that impair the culture's ability to form product [7][8]. So called <b><i>growth-coupled production</i></b> (i.e. obligate coupling of the synthesis of specific target products with bacterial growth) can help stabilize production traits. When the formation of product and biomass are aligned, non-producing mutants that emerge spontaneously are outcompeted by the fitter producing strains according to Darwinian selection principles [9]. The theoretical framework behind the engineering of growth-coupled strategies has thus far been underpinned by the same principle - linking a product-forming pathway to the capacity of the cell to regenerate energy and/or redox co-factors. This principle has been proposed for photoautotrophs but never successfully implemented in the laboratory [10]. The cause behind this has to do with the plasticity conferred by all the alternative electron flows surrounding the photosystems I and II, which makes it very difficult to achieve the desired strict coupling. However, recent advancements in the designing of metabolic engineering growth-coupled production strategies may bring the solution to this hurdle.</p>",

Instead of using energy or redox regeneration, this is now based on the direct stoichiometric coupling of pathways uniquely responsible for the formation of biomass precursors to the production of target compounds. This is achieved through the deletion of the native metabolic route(s) that cells have to reintroduce side-products of anabolism, leading to their accumulation, and hence, ensuring their growth-coupled production.<br>This concept has been developed into an algorithm to 'Find Reactions Usable In Tapping Side-products' - FRUITS. By analyzing existing genome-scale metabolic models, it identifies anabolic side-products that can be coupled to cell growth by the deletion of their re-utilization pathway(s). This pipeline is freely-available at <a href='https://gitlab.com/mmp-uva/fruits.git' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>https://gitlab.com/mmp-uva/fruits.git</a>. When applied to <i>Synechocystis</i> growing under photoautotrophic conditions, FRUITS predicts that nine compounds can be coupled to growth, of which one is fumarate. <br>Prediction is that during growth, so in the light (or during the day in an industrial setting), fumarate is produced as a by-product of specific anabolic reactions within purine and urea metabolism and then re-assimilated through the TCA cycle via the activity of <i>fumC</i> (fumarase). If the only fumarate assimilation pathway present is removed, by the engineering of a <i>fumC</i> deletion strain, FRUITS predicts that fumarate will be accumulated (fig.2.1). While the precise localization of fumarate is not important in silico, in our  <a href='/Export.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>module on transport</a> we have clarified this in reality as, according to <a href='/Gold_Integrated.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>experts</a> engaged in our project, it is very important for the economic feasibility of the technology here developed.

This was achieved by dosing the biomass specific light flux to intensities ranging from 30 to 100 &#956;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>OD<sup>-1</sup>. For each cultivation maintained at a different growth rate, samples were taken at different sampling times to quantify extracellular fumarate concentration. Fumarate productivities were subsequently calculated and plotted against the respective growth rate (fig. 3.A). The results obtained indicate that fumarate productivity is indeed proportional to cell growth rate, implying that both physiological traits are strongly coupled as here desired. Furthermore, we compared the linear fit between fumarate productivity and growth rate based on our experiment, with the outcome of the simulations using FBA on the metabolic network reconstruction of <i>Synechocystis</i>. It is important to highlight that we did not in anyway tweak the modeling parameters, which were taken directly from the original report [11]. Still, both fits match strikingly well, corroborating that indeed the hypothesis that fumarate production and growth rate are aligned in the <i>&#916;</i><i>fumC</i> strain seems to hold up to scrutiny. <br>We also calculated the carbon partitioning towards fumarate in the <i>&#916;</i><i>fumC</i> strain during the multiple cultivations carried out (Fig. 3B). We did not see any significant changes in carbon partitioning irrespective of the biomass specific light flux. This indicates that irrespective of the growth rate, as long as cells are illuminated, the fumarate yield on biomass is constant. This result also support theoretical predictions, which state that fumarate production is only affected by environmental conditions to the extent that the latter affect growth. In other words, that fumarate production is <b>stoichiometrically</b> and <b>obligatorily</b> coupled to growth. </p>",

As explained above, the root of the instability comes from Darwinian selection for fitter strains. When using classical metabolic engineering strategies, the fitter strains are the non-producing ones; When using our new growth-coupled strategy, it should be the producing ones. Conditions in which cells are under a strong selection pressure for fastest growth and in which the propagation bottlenecks are smallest, are predicted to result in the fastest drops in productivity [12]. Such conditions, while maintaining the total population size relatively constant, are best met under turbidostat cultivation [13], and so these provide the harshest test ground to assess the stability of production strains. <br>We cultivated the <i>&#916;</i><i>fumC</i> strain under turbidostat regimes operated at non-light limiting conditions at maximal growth rate extending for over 3 weeks. During this period we did not observe any significant changes in production rate (fig.2.4A) - a true testament to the stability of our daytime fumarate producing strain. As a control, we compared how a <i>Synechocystis</i> strain that was engineered using classical approaches to produce lactate [14] fairs under the same conditions. Lactate production in this strain was achieved by the heterologous expression of lactate dehydrogenase from Lactococcus lactis, yielding an initial carbon partitioning as the one here reported for fumarate. As theory would dictate, lactate production was lost within 5 to 10 days for this strain (fig.2.4B). This result reinforces the stringency with which this regimes selects for fitter cells, which when using our engineering method, means the producing ones.</p>",

The pre-cultures (OD<sub>730</sub> &#8776; 2) from the shake flask were used for inoculation in the Multi-Cultivator, with an initial OD<sub>730</sub> of 0.05 and working volume of 60 ml. Continuous light was given at fixed light intensity of 30 &#956;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> after inoculation, and 120 &#956;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> when OD<sub>730</sub> reached 0.5. Samples were taken daily, where OD was recorded and supernatant was prepared. Regarding the photonfluxostats[16], all the cultivation conditions are the same as for batch cultivation except for the light intensity settings. Light intensity was 30 &#956;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> after inoculation. When OD<sub>720</sub> (measured through the build-in OD sensor of the Multi-Cultivator at 720 nm calibrated to the external spectrophotometer at 730 nm) was above 0.6, light intensity was automatically adjusted every 5 min to ensure light intensity per OD<sub>720</sub> was constant. This light regime was maintained until maximum capacity of the LED panel was reached. Under photonfluxostat mode, a &#34;steady-state&#34; would be achieved and constant growth rate can be reliably obtained.

In this continuous cultivation method, microbial populations are kept at a fixed biomass density by diluting the culture with fresh medium at the same rate as the populations grows. This feedback loop applies a strong selection pressure on cells to grow at the maximal specific growth rate. The turbidostat setup used in this experiment is based on a modified Multi-Cultivator, with additional pumps (Reglo ICC, ISMATEC, Germany) transferring fresh medium to the cultures, and subsequently, to a waste container (i.e. as in a classical chemostat). The &#34;pycultivator&#34; software package that controls the Multi-Cultivator and adjunct hardware, additionally sets the pumps to dilute the cultures if the selected OD<sub>720</sub> threshold is reached. Cells from pre-cultures in shake flasks were inoculated at OD<sub>720</sub> ~0.05 in 4 independent cylindrical vessels of the Multi-Cultivator, using the same conditions as specified before, except for the incident light intensity, which was fixed at 100 &#956;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The OD<sub>720</sub> was recorded every 5 min. When the threshold of OD<sub>720</sub> > 0.6 was reached, cultures were diluted by 8% (v/v) with fresh BG11. Strain stability was assessed by monitoring growth rate and fumarate and lactate production in time. Growth rate was calculated by fitting a linear function through the natural logarithm of the OD<sub>720</sub> during each cell &#34;growth-dilution&#34; cycle. Samples for exometabolite production were collected periodically throughout the cultivation period. The variation in production rate, expressed in percentage, was calculated relative to the one observed at the beginning of the cultivation experiment.</p>",

              "<p>Experts in the field of biotechnology explained to us that production with photoautotrophs is to the best of their knowledge not been explored. After all the claim to fame of these organisms is precisely their ability to use the energy of light. Nonetheless, a significant part of the energy from light captured during the day is used by these organisms to make storage compounds such as glycogen [24] or poly-hydroxybutyrate[25]. If we explore the production possibilities of fumarate in <i>Synechocystis</i> during the night, we face a challenge. As <i>Synechocystis</i> does not grow without sunlight, the growth coupled production strategy of fumarate is not possible during the night. Thus, we expect no growth coupled fumarate production. But is there another strategy in which we can exploit the night to produce fumarate?<br>In order to survive the night, <i>Synechocystis</i> produces energy by catabolizing its glycogen storage [24]. The TCA cycle is often associated with this process as it provides the electron carriers for ATP production via respiration.  As fumarate is an intermediate metabolite in the TCA cycle, increasing the carbon flux through the TCA cycle could be exploited to increase fumarate production during the night. <br>An unexpected challenge, probably quite unique to photoautotrophs, that emerged is that flux measurements experimentally determined that <i>Synechocystis</i> does not use the TCA cycle at night as anticipated, but as rather evolved to prefer the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) [15]. During the night, the PPP can also act as an additional electron carrier producing pathway, which is preferred over the TCA cycle in <i>Synechocystis</i> for this function [15], potentially because it does not release so much of the energy already stored in the carbon bonds. End-product of PPP will be a pentose (5 carbon skeleton), while the TCA cycle will produce CO<sub>2</sub> which was so costly to fix in the first place! <br>To increase the flux through the TCA cycle, we took a modeling approach, which predicted that we could increase flux towards the TCA cycle by deletion of the <i>zwf</i> gene, which codes for  Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. It catalyzes the first step in the PPP. By removing the PPP, our <a href='/Model.html#ppp' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>model</a> predicts that the cell is then forced to have a higher flux towards the TCA cycle to reconcile the loss in reducing equivalent production. When combined with the <i>fumC</i> deletion, this will lead to an increased production of fumarate, which we have tested (and confirmed) in a photonfluxostat experiment. </p>",

              "<p>It must be noted however, that nighttime fumarate production can be perceived as finite since it relies on the glycogen storages that were built up during the day. The reported QP is calculated by looking at the night as whole. Although the comparisons between the strains are still valid, it is important to understand that QP is not necessarily constant throughout the night as it depends on the dynamics of glycogen catabolism.The <i>&#916;</i><i>fumC</i> strain produced fumarate during the night, and albeit not much, still it directly contradicts our model predictions. Even if we do not correct for OD, there is an increase in fumarate concentration during the night (fig. 2.8), further supporting that the <i>&#916;</i><i>fumC</i> indeed (unexpectedly) produces fumarate during the night. This can be easily explained by one of the pitfalls of constraint based analysis techniques such as the ones we used - they assume optimality. The dynamic flux balance analysis predicts that using the PPP at night is preferred over the TCA, and hence, the corresponding flux distributions deduced do not lead to fumarate production. The thing is that Life does not always have to conform to the optimality principles that underlie the modeling, as there might be other factors which are not captured in the model at play. For instance, one could speculate that cells adopt an anticipatory behavior during the night and want to make some amino acids that are derived from TCA intermediates. That could explain why a residual flux towards the TCA could still be beneficial. One thing remains clear, though - deletion of the <i>zwf</i> gene combined with the <i>fumC</i> drastically increases fumarate production in the dark - nearly 3 fold! This also opens up possibilities for the production of other TCA cycle intermediates at night with <i>Synechocystis</i> </p>",

However, by knocking out fumarase, we disrupted the cyclic nature of  the TCA, which may no longer operate as a cycle. This construct yields one fumarate per glycogen catabolized. We started wondering if there could be a way to use synthetic biology to improve the nighttime production efficiency in terms of carbon usage. We turned to nature for inspiration&#8230;  <br>Many microorganisms express a glyoxylate shunt. The glyoxylate shunt consists of two enzymes which are not natively present in <i>Synechocystis</i>: isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS). The first enzyme, ICL, catalyzes the reaction of isocitrate into glyoxylate and succinate, where succinate can then be consumed by succinate dehydrogenase to produce fumarate and FADPH2. As for glyoxylate, this compound is then consumed by MS, along with acetyl-CoA, to make malate. Malate is then converted to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase, yielding NADPH (fig. 2.11). </p>",

              "<p>We found that the glyoxylate shunt must be well timed: it cannot be active during the day, as the glyoxylate shunt will draw carbon from more prefered pathways. We are thus faced with another challenge: how do we time the expression of the glyoxylate shunt such that the cell has a fitness advantage, while partitioning more carbon to fumarate synthesis? Clearly, only expressing the glyoxylate shunt during the night with the right expression levels is hard. The expression level and timing of a gene is, at the very least, partially regulated through its promoter. That is why we aim to look for a promoter with the right expression pattern for the shunt genes to be activate only in the night. Photoreceptor-based transcriptional circuits could at a first glance be suitable control systems. However, the delays between transcriptional activation (or repression) and the actual increase (or drop) in enzyme levels can be many hours depending for instance on protein stability. Such delay could be sufficient to remove the competitive edge of harboring the genes encoding the shunt, and therefore, rendering it phenotypically unstable. <br><i>Synechocystis</i> harbors circadian clocks with periods close to 24 h [18]. Chances are, that there already is a promoter present in its chromosome with the right expression levels at the right time for our glyoxylate shunt enzymes. These cellular clocks allow organisms to anticipate the environmental cycles of day and night by synchronizing circadian rhythms with the rising and setting of the sun. The rhythms originate from the oscillator components of circadian clocks and control global gene expression and various cellular processes, hinting at the presence of an appropriate promoter for our shunt genes. To express the glyoxylate shunt only during the night and with the right expression levels, we aim to use what nature has to offer and make a glyoxylate shunt promoter library. </p>",

We required our final library to be integrated into the the genome at the neutral site <i>slr0168</i> of <i>Synechocystis</i> to ensure that the difference in observed phenotype can be attributed to the difference in promoter, rather than something else (e.g. changes in plasmid copy number).

Polyploidy poses a challenge in creating a stable mutant strain, since the newly introduced genes have to be 'fully segregated' (i.e. present in all chromosome copies) to avoid that they revert to wild type in future generations. However, a fully segregated promoter library in <i>Synechocystis</i> is something that has not yet been reported and poses a major challenge - How does one guarantee that all members of the library are fully segregated? - Our supervisor, told us that we had three options:</p>",
              "<ul class='produce-list'><li>Quit here;</li><li>Colony PCR tens of thousands of colonies;</li><li>Or come up with a new method to do it.</li></ul>",
              "<p>We chose the latter and decided to develop a method to create a fully segregated (promoter) libraries in polyploid organisms. <br>The strategy we developed employs the <a href='/Method.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>markerless method </a> that facilitates the selection for fully segregated colonies. This procedure is based on the negative selection method using the toxic gene <i>mazF</i> [20]. The <i>mazF</i> gene is an endoribonuclease that is regulated by a nickel-induced element (NIE) [21], killing the cells upon exposure to elevated concentrations of nickel. The <i>mazF</i> cassette needs to be introduced into the neutral site <i>slr0168</i> of the <i>Synechocystis</i> genome, enabling the introduction of the glyoxylate shunt into the neutral site at later time points, replacing the <i>mazF</i> cassette itself. With this selection method, complete segregation of the glyoxylate shunt in the genome can be tested simply by adding nickel - if the colony is not fully segregated, even if there is only one copy of the <i>mazF</i>-cassette in the genome, the cell will be killed upon exposure to nickel! However, when a colony is fully segregated, and all the <i>mazF</i> cassettes are replaced by glyoxylate shunt genes, the colony remains unharmed. Furthermore, we wanted the glyoxylate shunt promoter library to represent the entire genome (i.e. as many colonies as possible to reach a probability of having all the positions in the chromosome in the library at least once approaching 100%). To expand the library, we allowed the cells time to segregate before exposing them to nickel, as cells often shift towards full segregation over time [22].  A positive selection marker was used to push cells towards full segregation. However, high amounts of antibiotics might hamper cell growth and thereby slow down segregation. Studying the segregation dynamics, we found the sweet-spot between antibiotic concentration and the timing before exposing cells to nickel: after transformation (day 0), cells were supplemented with kanamycin (50 &#956;g/ml) on day 1 and nickel 20 &#956;M on day 4 (fig. 2.14). <br>Using our newly developed method, we created the first fully segregated library representing the entire genome (99.9% confidence) of <i>Synechocystis</i> upstream of the glyoxylate shunt genes. What is more; the library is now ready to be tested. The beauty of the glyoxylate shunt promoter library approach lies in the fact that expressing the shunt at both the appropriate time and level increases fitness. Therefore, we can now easily select the ideal promoter using long term cultivations and letting Darwinian selection do the rest. The promoter that expresses the shunt the most optimally will be the one that grows the fastest, outcompeting the rest of the population. This will also be the best fumarate producer, which will eventually be used to further increase the nighttime fumarate production.</p>",

The efflux of fumarate that is taking place can be either the result of passive diffusion, or facilitated by a transport system. Fumarate is a dicarboxylic acid and has dissociation constants far below the intracellular pH of <I>Synechocystis</i>. This causes fumarate to be almost completely in its ionized form, which makes it much harder to diffuse across a hydrophobic membrane. A native fumarate transport system in <I>Synechocystis</i> is yet to be identified, but this strongly suggests a transport mechanism of some kind must to be present.</p>",
              "<p>A transport mechanism in the form of a protein can be studied by knocking out the encoding gene and study the resulting phenotype. To this end, we are forced to first identify candidate genes that may putatively encode fumarate transport proteins within the genome of <I>Synechocystis</i>. Membrane transporters are notorious for being promiscuous, often displaying affinity for multiple substrates [1]. However, their specificity for certain chemical properties (e.g. presence of two carboxylic acid groups) is often sufficiently conserved across phylogenetic clades [2], making it possible to attempt the identification of genes by sequence comparisons (i.e. by homology searching). Sequence alignments unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structure when the pairwise sequence identity is high (>40% for long alignments) [3]. Below 35%, the number of false positives increases tremendously and one can no longer infer a homologous relationship. Up to now, no C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter has been identified in <I>Synechocystis</i>, which already indicates that the search will not yield an unambiguous result. We went to see an expert in the field: <a href='/Attributions.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>Anton Feenstra</a>, an Assistant Professor Bioinformatics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>",
              "<p>Together we designed a pipeline to tackle the problem from every possible angle, aiming to provide the support required for an educated selection. We made use of targeted searches, where we used sequence information from known, phylogenetically closely related transporters, but also protein motifs and conserved domains as a template for sequence alignment. Complementary, untargeted searches were used to profile large groups of sequences (including putative identifications) and find distant homologous relationships between proteins.</p>",

              "<p>(1) Several proteins(families) are involved in C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transport (e.g. Dcu-, Dct- and TRAP-transporters). For each of these target groups, sets of 200 transporter(domain) sequences were profiled using PRALINE<sup>&#8482;</sup>, an alignment method that integrates membrane-specific scoring matrices to improve alignment of the transmembrane regions [4]. It creates a Multiple Sequence Alignment file (MSA), that is taken as a template for HHSearch, present-day, the most sensitive protein sequence alignment method [5]. HHSearch computes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), similar to simple sequence profiles, but in addition to the amino acid frequencies in the columns of a MSA, they contain the position-specific probabilities for inserts and deletions along the alignment. The HMM is then aligned against the sequence database of  <I>Synechocystis</i> (tax id: 1148, which is a profile-profile alignment. By aligning profile HMMs instead of simple sequence profiles, both sensitivity and alignment quality improve significantly. This allows for the identification of more distant homologous relationships. </p>",

In <I>Synechococcus elongatus</i>, two C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter(domain)s have been identified: DctM and DctA. In <I>N. Spumigena</i>, a DcuC transporter is putatively identified based on sequence homology studies. In separate searches, each of the gene sequences was used as a template to create a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), using PSI-BLAST on the NCBI NR db [6]. This was done in order to 'enrich' the sequence with information from related sequences.. ClustalX is used to create a MSA out of the PSSM, as this is the most sensitive method that is able to take a PSSM as template [7]. The MSA is subsequently taken as a template for HHSearch.</p>",

Therefore, more extensive experiment have to be done on this transporter to confirm its function.</li><li>The transporters were turned into versatile <a href='/Parts.html' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>BioBricks</a> (<a href='http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2385001' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>Bba_K2385001</a> and <a href='/http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2385000' class='in-text-link' target='_blank'>Bba_K2385000</a>) that have the potential to increase the yields of any organic acid producing cell factory.</li><li>A next step would be to express DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS on the &#916;fumC background that is already producing fumarate to see if this could further boost fumarate production. This will test simultaneously whether intracellular fumarate was the limiting factor in the experiment described above; and whether it is inhibiting its own production, and potentially even growth, in the strain with the &#916;fumC genotype.</li></ul>",
