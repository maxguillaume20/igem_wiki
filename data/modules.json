              "<p>Currently fumarate concentrations in liquid samples can be quantified through two well-developed methods, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzymatic assays. Both methods are costly and labor intensive. In our search for cyanobacterial cell-factories we need to measure fumarate concentrations very often. Measurements need to be accurate and specific to fumarate, and on top of that measuring should be quick and easy. Fortunately, synthetic biology may be used to derive a solution to this inspired in nature.</p>",
              "<p>Bacteria have evolved to use two-component systems (TCS) to sense and adapt to changes in the extracellular environment. These systems are often highly specific to particular compounds and accurate in their measurement [1]. A TCS typically consists of a sensor histidine kinase (SHK) and a response regulator. The first sits in the membrane and gets activated upon sensing particular signals such as a specific compound The second gets activated by an active SHK and can then bind to DNA at specific loci to initiate a biological response [2]. We construct a fumarate biosensor based on the DcuSZ/OmpR chimeric TCS developed in <i>E. coli</i> by Ganesh et al. (2013) [3]. The SHK in this system, DcuSZ, is a fusion of two native <i>E. coli</i> SHKs, fumarate sensor DcuS and osmolarity sensor EnvZ. The protein domains in DcuSZ are the extracellular sensing domain and transmembrane domains of DcuS and the intracellular HAMP and histidine kinase domains of EnvZ. Coupling the emerging TCS to the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein leads to cells that fluoresce in response to extracellular fumarate (fig. 4.1).</p>",

Coupling this to fluorescent protein (EYFP) expression by using the ompC promoter leads to sensing and reporting of fumarate.</i></figcaption></figure>",
              "<p>We have created several differently fused DcuSZ genes to compare their functionality. The difference is in the length of the linker region between the DcuS and EnvZ functional domains. The linker region originates from the DcuS gene and forms an α-helix. A complete turn in an α-helix consists of approximately 3.6 amino acids, so by differing the linker length in steps of 5 amino acids we extend or shorten the α-helix by ~1.4 turns per step taken. This results in a titration of the different orientations of the EnvZ kinase relative to the membrane bound DcuS domains, and thus relative to the membrane. We expect the linker length and kinase orientation play a central role in the functionality of the system. By creating 9 DcuSZ genes with different lengths (fig. 4.2), at least one of them, and at best two, are predicted to be close to the optimal orientation. By taking more than one turn per step we also scan a relatively large range of distance between the DcuS and EnvZ functional domains. This may influence the kinetics of binding and activation of the engineered TCS, possibly leading to variants with different detection limits and signal dynamic ranges for fumarate. For detailed descriptions on strain cultivation, plasmid construction, testing conditions and data analysis see the <a class=in-text-link href='/Detect.html#method1'>methods section.</a></p>",

This screening suggested that strains 1, 6 and to some extent 9 are functioning as biosensors. The screening also showed that the response in fluorescence/OD<sub>600</sub> is robust over time. Times of measurement were quite high, namely 16 and 22 hours, because the signalling system was only induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) upon addition of fumarate. Ideally the system would be induced before adding fumarate, as in our case there is more time in which the strains can take up the fumarate. However, fumarate uptake is repressed by the presence of glucose in the medium [4].</p>",

By fitting a logistic curve to the data the detection limits and saturation levels of each sensing strain can be determined. Several nice examples of the logistic nature of similar sensing systems are shown by Pollard et al. (2016) [5]. By varying the linker length, and with that the kinase orientation, we expect to have changed the effectiveness of signal transduction in the chimeric DcuSZ protein. While intuitively one might expect only the range of signal detection to differ as a consequence, in reality the dynamics of the fluorescence output vary widely (fig. 4.3).</p>",

DcuSZ 1 and 6 do have similar lengths, but DcuSZ 9 is 15-20 amino acids longer than DcuSZ 1 and 6, and yet strain 9 is also functional. The characterization suggests that strain 1 can be used to quantify fumarate concentrations up to 3 mM, strain 6 up to 6 mM and strain 9 even up to 20 mM (fig. 4.3). To quantify fumarate concentrations below 1 mM, calibration in the 0-1 mM range should be performed. While strain 9 can measure up to the highest fumarate concentration, it is less sensitive than strains 1 and 6. The logistic fit is the best for strain 6 and therefore its curve is the most trustworthy. The spread in the fluorescence/OD<sub>600</sub> of strain 1 is high, which leads to more uncertainty as to the level of saturation of this biosensor. The specificity to fumarate of these systems should be tested by comparing the response found here to the response to other C4-dicarboxylates (succinate, malate and aspartate). Previous work shows that the DcuSZ/OmpR system with the kinase orientation and linker length as they are in strain 1 is highly specific to fumarate [3].</p>"
