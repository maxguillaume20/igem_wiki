  In our quest to engineer fumarate-producing cyanobacterial cell factories we need a way to
quickly and easily determine if a given genetically engineered construct is actually producing
fumarate. For this purpose, we construct a biosensor, a strain of Escherichia Coli that is able
to sense and report presence of fumarate in the extracellular medium.
